, first foremost , think 's unfortunate u.s . one countries maternity leave paternity leave universally granted employers . think put place law mandating employers give paid maternity leave , would result unfair hiring biases women . employers would develop preference hiring men women , purely concerned profit lots employers , take risk hiring lady might take lot time work risk hire man ? already lot stereotypes women less dedicated jobs men `` focused kids '' . would n't mandatory maternity leave make worse ?

's totally theoretical comes question many nukes would make anyway , 's always possibility could stop , portion us population would protected . would n't want fighting back launching retaliatory strikes order keep alive ? third , probably importantly , 0rd point . reason exactly would launch retaliatory strike . russians know even wipe entire us population , wo n't world enjoy , strike retaliation , world would ruined . even us n't retaliate , earth would pretty messed . much radiation would cripple environment worldwide , radiation slowly spreads rest world . russia us know attack result winner , 's reason either attack . called mad 'm sure know , sake n't - mutually assured destruction . one second russia believed would n't retaliate , would n't hesitate kill us . reason 're still alive 're willing kill everyone russia . fourth , keep mind russia wanted stop us retaliating , 'd hit us everywhere , continental us .

answer seems hiding probabilities anyone expand 'm willing give deltas . also , problem reasoning , please leave explanation downvote understand 's . -- - struggle believe human beings naturally supposed attracted opposite sex inherently repulsed sex characteristics . think people identify straight convenience never needed question assumed .

'' great contrast fundamental principle selfish gene outlined richard dawkins . natural selection cares : genes . gene reproduced , successful , regardless whether individual carriers gene reproduce . explains homosexuality prevalent animals . sure , homosexual organism may personally reproduce , genes contribute behavior may distributed great many organisms . likely , closely related homosexual one . means combination genes produce homosexual organisms reasonable frequency give us collection related organisms , personally reproduce . theorized result additional caretakers , improving survivability cluster organisms mostly carry genes responsible . natural selection absolutely favor `` gay genes '' -- wo n't find stable population organisms gay obvious reasons . seems , many social species , genes pool better . i.e . , actually selected . may noticed key point . although genes contribute homosexuality combination , certain environmental factors , etc may well distributed throughout population , system appears work best number dedicated homosexual organisms minor fraction . phrase inexact terms , `` one per family '' . result , stable successful population homosexuality minority . important understand make bad , fact appears better survival collective gene pool homosexuality .
