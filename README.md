# Persuasion-Comments-Evaluation
1.Introduction

        Tensorflow Implementation of "Incorporating Argument-Level Interactions for Persuasion Comments Evaluation 
    using Co-attention Model". The dataset used in our paper can be download from the repository. 

2.Requirements

    Python 3.5 or higher

    Tensorflow >=1.0

3.Data Format

3.1 Dataset for persuasion comments evaluation

        The whole dataset consists of 3,456 training instances and 807 testing instances, where each instance includes 
    an original post with one positive and one negative reply respectively. We randomly select 10% of the training 
    instances to form the development set.

3.2 Annotated dataset for interactive argument pair extraction 

        We sample 50 triples in the form of (original post, positive reply, negative reply) from the training set 
    and split these into 100 original post-reply pairs in the form of (original post, positive reply) and 
    (original post, negative reply). Two annotators are hired to annotate the dataset independently and a third 
    annotator is asked to solve the conflict between the two annotators. we obtain 365 pairs in total. In detail, 
    234 interactive argument pairs come from positive replies, and the other 131 pairs are generated by negative 
    replies. Here's an example of such a file:

    He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster: existing in nature and not made or caused by people: coming from 
    nature (URL) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural. <<<===>>>Look at the definition you 
    provided, if we remove the exclusion of things which humans create: existing in nature and not made or caused 
    by people ~so essentially, by this definition, natural things are things that exist, which is frankly rather 
    meaningless.

    He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster: existing in nature and not made or caused by people: coming from 
    nature (URL) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural. <<<===>>> You're using natural to mean 
    definition 8 the universe, with all its phenomena. The more common definition is definition 1 the material world, 
    especially as surrounding humankind and existing independently of human activities. 

    He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster: existing in nature and not made or caused by people: coming from 
    nature (URL) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural. <<<===>>> So by definition we are not 
    part of nature, as nature is more commonly used, and is in this sense used, to refer to things that exist 
    independently of human activities. 
    
    Notes:
        (1) Reply 1 and 2 indicate the positive reply and negative reply, respectively. 
        (2) The argument on the left of "<<<===>>>" is from original post and the argument on the right is from reply.
        (3) <<<===>>> indicates the interactive relationship.
